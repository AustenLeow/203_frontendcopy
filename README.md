# CS203 G1-T2 Marketplace App Frontend

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```
npm run dev
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.



```
npm run build
```
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!
